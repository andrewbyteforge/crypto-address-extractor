üìã How to Use
Basic Extraction

Select CSV/Excel files containing addresses
Click "Extract Addresses"
Review results in the generated Excel file

With API Enhancement

Enable "Chainalysis API analysis" in Extract Addresses tab
Select desired API options (balance, exposure, cluster info)
Run extraction - API data will appear in Excel sheets
Check individual crypto sheets for Entity Name and Exchange Exposure

Understanding the Output

Entity Name: The cluster/service name associated with the address (e.g., "Binance Hot Wallet")
Exchange Exposure: Percentage of funds exposed to various exchanges
Unique Addresses: Each crypto sheet shows addresses only once, even if they appear multiple times in source files

üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
API Settings

Configure Chainalysis API key in Settings tab
Adjust concurrent API calls (1-20 threads)
Choose output currency (USD/Native)

Extraction Options

Enable/disable checksum validation
Select specific cryptocurrencies to extract
Add custom cryptocurrency patterns

üìà Best Practices

For Large Datasets: Use the API "SMART" strategy to prioritize high-value addresses
Duplicate Handling: Check "All Addresses" sheet to see all occurrences, individual crypto sheets for unique addresses only
API Usage: Enable only needed API endpoints to optimize processing time
Excel Files: Close Excel files before re-running extraction to avoid permission errors

üîç Troubleshooting
Common Issues

API data not appearing: Ensure "Enable Chainalysis API analysis" is checked
Excel permission errors: Close the output file before running extraction
Missing methods error: Run the fix_missing_methods.py script
Duplicate addresses: Now automatically removed from crypto sheets

Recent Fixes Applied

api_excel_export_patch.py: Fixes API data not appearing in Excel
fix_report_items_error.py: Resolves report generation errors
fix_missing_methods.py: Handles missing analysis sheet methods
remove_duplicates_crypto_sheets.py: Removes duplicate addresses from crypto sheets
