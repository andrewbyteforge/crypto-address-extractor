Crypto Address Extractor - Project Overview

What It Does
The Crypto Address Extractor is a comprehensive Python application designed to automatically find, extract, and analyze cryptocurrency addresses from various data sources. Think of it as a specialized forensic tool that can scan through files and identify cryptocurrency addresses, then provide detailed intelligence about those addresses.

Primary Functions:

Address Discovery: Scans CSV and Excel files to automatically detect cryptocurrency addresses using advanced pattern matching
Multi-Format Support: Handles multiple file formats including CSV files and Excel workbooks with multiple sheets
Intelligence Enhancement: Integrates with Chainalysis API to provide real-world intelligence about discovered addresses
Professional Reporting: Generates comprehensive Excel reports, i2 Analyst's Notebook files, and other formats for investigation purposes

Core Capabilities
File: extractor.py - Core address extraction logic
Function: extract_from_files() - Main extraction method
Supported Cryptocurrencies (30+ types):

Bitcoin (BTC) - All formats: Legacy (P2PKH), SegWit (P2SH), and Bech32
Ethereum (ETH) - With EIP-55 checksum validation
Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR)
Tron (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP)
Stellar (XLM), and many more

File: validators.py, enhanced_validators.py - Address validation
Function: Various validate() methods with checksum verification
Advanced Validation Features:

Cryptographic checksum validation for supported currencies
Confidence scoring (0-100) for each detected address
Format detection (e.g., Bitcoin P2PKH vs P2WPKH vs Taproot)
Duplicate detection and tracking

Chainalysis API Integration
File: gui_api_processor.py, iapi_service.py - API integration
Function: enhance_with_chainalysis_api() - Enriches addresses with real-world data
API-Enhanced Data:
Entity Names: Identifies known services (e.g., "Binance Hot Wallet")
Exchange Exposure: Shows percentage exposure to major exchanges
Risk Assessment: Provides risk levels based on transaction behavior
Balance Information: Current balances and transaction volumes
Cluster Analysis: Groups related addresses by ownership

User Interface Options

Output Formats
File: file_handler.py - Excel export functionality
Function: save_to_excel_with_analysis() - Comprehensive Excel generation
Excel Output Structure:

Summary Sheet: Overview statistics and extraction metadata
All Addresses Sheet: Complete list with duplicate marking
Individual Crypto Sheets: Separate sheets per cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
Duplicate Analysis Sheet: Groups and analyzes duplicate occurrences
Column Definitions Sheet: User guide for understanding data

File: i2_exporter.py - Investigative analysis export
Function: export_investigation_data() - Generates i2 Analyst's Notebook files
Additional Export Formats:

i2 Analyst's Notebook (XML): For link analysis and visualization
CSV Export: Raw data for further analysis
PDF Reports: Professional investigation summaries

Technical Architecture
File: patterns.py - Regex pattern definitions
Function: CryptoPatterns.get_all_patterns() - Pattern library
Core Components:

Pattern Matching Engine: Advanced regex patterns for each cryptocurrency
Validation Framework: Modular validator system with fallback support
File Processing: Handles large Excel files with multiple sheets
Progress Tracking: Real-time progress updates during processing
Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and graceful error recovery

File: performance_monitor.py, logger_config.py - System optimization
Function: Performance tracking and detailed logging
